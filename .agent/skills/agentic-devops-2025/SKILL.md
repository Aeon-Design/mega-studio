# 🚀 Agentic DevOps 2025

## 🤖 AI-Powered CI/CD
- **Predictive Build Failure:** AI analyzes PR changes to predict potential build or test failures before running.
- **Automated Fix Recommendations:** CI pipelines suggest code fixes when common errors occur (e.g., dependency mismatches).
- **Codemagic/GitHub Actions 2.0:** Leveraging AI for optimized runner selection and caching strategies.

## 🛠️ Self-Healing IaC
- **Dynamic Scaling:** AI-managed Terraform/CloudFormation that adjusts resources based on real-time traffic patterns.
- **Auto-Rollback:** Automated rollback to last known stable state if AI detects anomaly post-deployment.

## 🛡️ DevSecOps Automation
- **SAST/DAST Gates:** Mandatory AI-driven security scans for every PR.
- **SBOM Management:** Automated generation and audit of Software Bill of Materials for dependency vulnerabilities.
