# 🚀 Growth Hacking & Viral Mechanics

Combined skill from: `launch-strategy`, `referral-program`, `marketing-psychology`.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Launch Strategy (The ORB Framework)
- **Owned:** Email list, Blog, Community (Long-term value)
- **Rented:** Social Media, Product Hunt (High spikes, low retention)
- **Borrowed:** Influencers, Guest posts (Trust transfer)

**Expertise:**
- Product Hunt Launch (Pre-launch hype, Launch day battle plan)
- Waitlist Psychology (FOMO, Scarcity)
- Beta Invite Drip (Slow rollout vs Big Bang)

### 2. Referral & Viral Loops
**The Loop:** `Trigger -> Share -> Convert -> Reward`

- **Incentive Design:**
  - Double-sided (Dropbox style: You get X, Friend gets Y)
  - Tiered (Unlock features at 5, 10, 20 invites)
  - Altruistic (Donate to charity)
- **Viral Coefficient (K-Factor):** Target K > 1.0 for exponential growth.

### 3. Marketing Psychology (Mental Models)
- **Scarcity:** "Only 5 invites left"
- **Social Proof:** "Joined by 10,000 designers"
- **Endowment Effect:** "You have completed 80% of your profile"
- **Loss Aversion:** "Don't lose your 7-day streak"

## Usage

```bash
# Launch Plan
/launch-strategy --product "AdhanLife" --channels "ProductHunt,Twitter"

# Viral Loop Design
/referral-program --model "double-sided" --reward "Premium Unlock"
```
