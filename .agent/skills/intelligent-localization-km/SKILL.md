# 🧠 Intelligent Localization & KM

## 🌎 Cultural Localization (Hyper-Local)
- **LLM Nuance:** Moving beyond literal translation to capture local slang, idioms, and cultural context.
- **Multimedia Localization:** Automated subtitling and localized voice-over for audio/video assets.
- **Inclusivity Audits:** Ensuring localized content is respectful and culturally sensitive.

## 📚 AI-Driven Knowledge Management (KM)
- **Auto-Documentation:** AI generates documentation from code/discussions in real-time.
- **Gap Detection:** Identifying missing info in knowledge bases and alerting the relevant team.
- **Semantic Search:** Enabling concepts-based search instead of just keyword matching.
- **Multilingual Knowledge:** Instant access to technical docs in multiple languages.
