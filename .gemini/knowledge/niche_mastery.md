# Niche Discovery & Mastery Grimoire 🔭

> **Domain:** R&D, Innovation, Market Scouting, App Ideation.
> **Goal:** 100% Success rate in entering and dominating niche markets.

## 🔍 Niche Scouting Framework
- **The Gap Theory:** Find where software is too generic.
- **Forum Mining:** Search Reddit/Quora for "Is there an app that...?" or "I hate it when [app] doesn't [feature]".
- **Review Scraping:** Look at 1-star and 2-star reviews of top competitors to find specific missing features.

## 📏 Opportunity Scoring (Matrix)
| Metric | High Score (5) | Low Score (1) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Pain Level** | "I lose money/time daily" | "It's slightly annoying" |
| **Competition** | Zero or 10-year-old apps | Saturated with giants |
| **Distribution** | Clear ASO keywords found | "Requires viral marketing" |
| **LTV** | Subscription/High Utility | One-time / Low novelty |

## 🚀 The Entry Hook (Moat)
- **Extreme Specialization:** Don't build a "CRM". Build a "CRM for Window Washers".
- **Zero Friction:** Solve the 'Task' 10x faster than the bloated competitor.
- **AI-Native:** Use AI to do 90% of the manual work the old apps require.

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation
- **The 'Why Now' Test:** Why hasn't this been solved? Is there a new API or technology (like LLM) that makes it possible *now*?
- **Platform Risk:** Does the niche depend on a single API that could be closed?
