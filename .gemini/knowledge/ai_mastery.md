# AI Mastery Grimoire 🤖

> **Domain:** Machine Learning, LLM Integration, Agentic Workflows.
> **Goal:** Building the smartest applications in the market.

## 🧠 LLM Integration
- **Context Management:** Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for long-term memory.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Use Chain-of-Thought and Few-Shot prompting for complex logic.
- **Streaming:** Always stream LLM responses for perceived speed.

## 🧬 Agentic Workflows
- **Tool Use:** Enable agents to call APIs, search the web, and run code.
- **Self-Correction:** Agents must verify their own output before presenting it to the user.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Use specialized agents for different parts of the reasoning chain.

## 📊 Data Privacy
- **Local Models:** Use On-Device ML (TensorFlow Lite, Mediapipe) for sensitive data.
- **Anonymization:** Strip PII before sending data to cloud-based LLM providers.

## 🚀 Performance
- **Quantization:** Use quantized models (4-bit/8-bit) for edge device inference.
- **Caching:** Cache frequent LLM responses to reduce latency and cost.
