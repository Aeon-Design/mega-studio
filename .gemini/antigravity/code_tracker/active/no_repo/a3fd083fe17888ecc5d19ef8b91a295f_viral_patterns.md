Ú# ğŸ“º YouTube Viral Patterns Grimoire

> **Owner:** YouTube Strategist / Copywriter
> **Purpose:** Algorithm hacking, retention psychology, and content optimization.

## ğŸ“ˆ The Algorithm (The Black Box)

### 1. CTR (Click-Through Rate) > 10%
*   **Thumbnail:** Faces show emotion (Shock/Joy). High contrast colors (Yellow/Black, Red/White).
*   **Title:** Curiosity Gap. "I tried X" vs "I tried X and died".
*   **Rule:** The title promises, the thumbnail teases.

### 2. AVD (Average View Duration) > 60%
*   **The Hook (0-3s):** Visual change every 1.5 seconds. No "Hello guys". Start in media res.
*   **The J-Cut:** Audio of next scene starts before video cuts. Keeps brain engaged.
*   **Pattern Interrupt:** Every 30 seconds, change the tempo/music/setting significantly.

## ğŸ£ Hook Database (Proven Winners)

1.  **The Negative Promise:** "Stop doing X if you want Y."
2.  **The Impossible Challenge:** "Can I survive 24 hours in Z?"
3.  **The Secret:** "The one setting changing your battery life forever."
4.  **The Comparison:** "$1 vs $1,000,000 Steak."

## ğŸ“ SEO & Metadata

*   **Tags:** Irrelevant in 2026. Focus on description keywords (first 2 lines).
*   **Chapters:** Essential. "Intro", "The Fail", "The Success". Google indexes these.

## ğŸ“Š Analytics Interpretation
*   **Dip at start:** Hook failed. Change intro.
*   **Gradual decline:** Content is boring. Cut fluff.
*   **Spike in middle:** Re-watchable moment. Make it a Short.
