# Implementation Plan - Macro Blueprint Indicator

The user wants to implement a comprehensive technical analysis tool based on a specific "Macro" investing tutorial. This tool focuses on high-timeframe trends, liquidity cycles, and weekly operating ranges.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Skills Missing**: The project [.agent](file:///c:/Users/Abdullah/Projects/g%C3%B6sterge/.agent) folder does not contain a `skills` subdirectory. I will proceed using the internal expertise of the **AlgoTrade Specialist** and the rules defined in [algotrade-specialist.md](file:///c:/Users/Abdullah/Projects/g%C3%B6sterge/.agent/agents/algotrade-specialist.md).

## Proposed Changes

### New Indicator: `Macro_Blueprint.pine`
I will create a brand new indicator that combines the specific logic requested.

#### [NEW] [Macro_Blueprint.pine](file:///c:/Users/Abdullah/Projects/gösterge/Macro_Blueprint.pine)
- **High Timeframe Moving Averages**:
    - 200 Daily SMA (The "Trend Baseline")
    - 50 Weekly SMA (The "Bull Support")
    - 100 Weekly SMA (The "Deep Value")
    - 200 Weekly SMA (The "Cycle Bottom")
- **Cycle Fibonacci Levels (The "Money Zones")**:
    - **Logic**: Auto-detect Major Cycle High/Low (Highest/Lowest of last 200-300 bars on Weekly).
    - **Levels**: 0.382, 0.5 (EQ), 0.618 (Golden Pocket).
    - **Extensions**: 1.618 etc. if requested, but focused on Retracements first.
- **Weekly Operating System**:
    - **Previous Week High/Low (PWH/PWL)**: Auto-plotted.
    - **Monday Range**:
        - Capture Monday's High and Low.
        - Calculate Monday EQ (0.5).
        - Plot Monday Extensions (Standard Deviations or Fib keys).
- **Anchored VWAP**:
    - Input for specific Start Time (as requested "6 Oct 2025" in text, will make it user-configurable).
- **"Heatmap" Dashboard**:
    - A table widget showing the distance/status of Price relative to all these keys:
        - "200W SMA: +15% (Bullish)"
        - "Weekly Range: Inside EQ"
        - "Monday Bias: Bearish (< EQ)"

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- **Pine Script Compiler**: Parse check to ensure no version 6 errors.
- **Visual Validation**:
    - Apply to `BTCUSDT` (as per video context).
    - Verify MAs match standard TradingView built-ins.
    - Verify Monday Range appears correctly on Intraday charts.

### Manual Verification
- **User Action**: Load the script on TradingView.
- **Check**:
    - Does the dashboard populate?
    - Do the "Weekly" MAs show up correctly even on the Daily/4H chart? (Using `request.security`).
