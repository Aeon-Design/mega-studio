# Project Titan: Macro Math Engine & Scanner

We have built a "Hedge Fund on a Laptop". This suite consists of two professional-grade tools designed to dominate high-timeframe trading.

## 1. Macro Math Engine ([Macro_Math_Engine.pine](file:///c:/Users/Abdullah/Projects/g%C3%B6sterge/Macro_Math_Engine.pine))
This is your **Single Asset Sniper**. It contains the entire mathematical core.

### The "Truth" Logic (Trend River)
-   **Bull Market**: Candles painting Green (Price > Daily 200 & Weekly 50).
-   **Bear Market**: Candles painting Red (Price < Daily 200 & Weekly 50).
-   **Generational Bottom**: Price touches Weekly 200 SMA (Thick Red Line).

### The "Money Zones" (Golden Grid)
-   Automatically detects the Cycle High/Low over 300 weeks.
-   Draws the **Golden Pocket (0.618)** and **Fair Value (0.5)**.

### Weekly Operating System
-   **Monday Range**: Blue Lines.
-   **Extensions**: Dotted lines showing statistical exhaustion points for the week.

### Automated Bot Strategy
-   **Trigger**: Trend is Bullish + Price breaks Monday High.
-   **Risk**: Auto-calculates lot size to risk 1% equity.
-   **Alerts**: JSON payloads ready for 3Commas (`{{strategy.order.alert_message}}`).

## 2. Macro Scanner ([Macro_Scanner.pine](file:///c:/Users/Abdullah/Projects/g%C3%B6sterge/Macro_Scanner.pine))
This is your **Market Radar**. It tracks 15+ assets simultaneously using the "Trend River" logic.

### How to Read the Dashboard
-   **BULLISH 🚀**: Asset is above Daily 200 AND Weekly 50. (Safe to buy dips).
-   **BEARISH 🐻**: Asset is below both. (Short rallies).
-   **VALUE?**: Asset is mixed (e.g., above D200 but below W50). Watch for reversal.
-   **vs D200**: Shows percentage distance from the baseline.

## Installation
1.  **Engine**: Copy [Macro_Math_Engine.pine](file:///c:/Users/Abdullah/Projects/g%C3%B6sterge/Macro_Math_Engine.pine) to a normal chart.
