# Project Titan: Macro Math Engine 🏗️

The user has elevated the request to a "Company-Defining" level. We are building the `Macro_Math_Engine` (Monster Scanner Edition).

## 1. Deep Math Analysis & Specification
- [x] Deconstruct the "Macro" video transcript into mathematical axioms.
    - [x] MAs: 200D, 50W, 100W, 200W rules (Trend vs Value).
    - [x] Fibs: 0.382, 0.5, 0.618, 1.618 (The "Money Zones").
    - [x] Monday Range: Standard Deviation Extensions (Math verification).
    - [x] Volume Profile: Value Area High/Low logic.
    - [x] Time Cycle: Anchored VWAP start points.
- [x] Define the "Scanner" architecture (Arrays & Loop logic).

## 2. Architecture Design
- [x] Create `Macro_Scanner.pine` (The Dashboard).
    - [x] Must handle 40 tickers (Binance + US Stock examples from video).
    - [x] Must use `request.security` tuple packing to save execution time.
- [x] Create `Macro_Strategy_Pro.pine` (The Execution Engine).
    - [x] Integration of "Scanner State" into single-chart backtester.

## 3. Implementation
- [x] **Phase A**: Math Engine (Library/Function).
- [x] **Phase B**: Scanner UI (Table Widget).
- [x] **Phase C**: Alert System (JSON Automation).
- [x] **Phase D**: CEO Verification (Does it dominate?).

## 4. Documentation
- [x] `Titan_Manual.md` (The "Blackboard" explanation).

# Phase 2: Project Titan V2 (The Upgrade)
## 1. Visual & UX Enhancements
- [x] **Smart Labels**: Add arrows/labels for Entry, SL, TP (like `Monster_Scanner`).
- [x] **Daily EQ**: Add Previous Day Equilibrium ((H+L)/2) level.
- [x] **Auto-Fibs**: Enhance Cycle Fibs to be "Automatic/Dynamic" (Pivot-based).

## 2. Decision Engine
- [x] **Win/Loss Stats**: Add Win/Loss Count to Dashboard.
- [x] **Multi-Asset Signal Panel**: Integrate `Monster_Scanner` table logic into the Strategy for "Market Overview".
- [x] **Decision Axioms**: Research and integrate "Decision Mechanisms" from user context.
