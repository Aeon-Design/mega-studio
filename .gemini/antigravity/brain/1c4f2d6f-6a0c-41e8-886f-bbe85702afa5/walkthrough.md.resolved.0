# Macro Blueprint Indicator - Walkthrough

I have created a new TradingView indicator [Macro_Blueprint.pine](file:///c:/Users/Abdullah/Projects/g%C3%B6sterge/Macro_Blueprint.pine) that consolidates the entire "Macro Operating System" described in the transcript. This is your command center for high-timeframe analysis.

## Key Features

### 1. High Timeframe Ribbons (The Trend)
Automatically plots the most critical Institutional Moving Averages, regardless of what timeframe you are viewing (e.g., viewing 15m chart but seeing Weekly 200 SMA).
- **Daily 200 SMA (Orange)**: The global baseline.
- **Weekly 50 SMA (Green)**: The bull market support band.
- **Weekly 200 SMA (Red)**: The "Cycle Bottom" or "Death Line".

### 2. Cycle Fibonacci (Money Zones)
- Automatically finds the Cycle High and Low over the last `N` weeks (Default: 200 weeks).
- Draws the **Golden Pocket (0.618 - 0.66)** and **EQ (0.5)** levels.
- These are your major "Buy/Sell" zones for long-term positions.

### 3. Weekly Operating System
- **Monday Range**: Automatically captures Monday's High & Low.
    - Draws the **Monday EQ** (Midpoint).
    - Draws **Extensions** (Standard Deviation targets) for the rest of the week.
- **Previous Week High/Low**: Auto-plotted circles to show simple weekly pivots.

### 4. Anchored VWAP
- A dedicated Anchored VWAP tool built-in.
- **Default Date**: Nov 18, 2024 (Adjustable in settings).
- Use this to track the "average price" since a specific major event (like the Cycle Low).

### 5. Macro Heatmap Dashboard
A panel in the bottom-right corner that gives you an instant "Health Check" of the asset.
- **Bullish/Bearish Status**: Based on price position relative to key MAs.
- **Distance**: Shows how far (%) price is from these key levels (e.g., "+15% above 200W SMA").

## How to Use
1.  Open **TradingView**.
2.  Open the **Pine Editor** tab at the bottom.
3.  Copy/Paste the code from [Macro_Blueprint.pine](file:///c:/Users/Abdullah/Projects/g%C3%B6sterge/Macro_Blueprint.pine).
4.  Click **"Add to Chart"**.
5.  **Adjust Inputs**:
    - Go to Settings (Gear Icon) on the indicator.
    - Change **"Anchor Year/Month/Day"** to match the specific low you want to track (e.g., the recent Bear Market Bottom).

## Visual Guide
> [!TIP]
> **Pro Tip**: Use this indicator on a **4-Hour** or **Daily** timeframe for the best clarity. The lines are visible on lower timeframes (15m), but they are best used for "Big Picture" bias before entering trades with the *Monster Strategy*.
