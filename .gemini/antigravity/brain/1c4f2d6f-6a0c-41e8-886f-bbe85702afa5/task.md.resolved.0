# Project Titan: Macro Math Engine 🏗️

The user has elevated the request to a "Company-Defining" level. We are building the `Macro_Math_Engine` (Monster Scanner Edition).

## 1. Deep Math Analysis & Specification
- [ ] Deconstruct the "Macro" video transcript into mathematical axioms.
    - [ ] MAs: 200D, 50W, 100W, 200W rules (Trend vs Value).
    - [ ] Fibs: 0.382, 0.5, 0.618, 1.618 (The "Money Zones").
    - [ ] Monday Range: Standard Deviation Extensions (Math verification).
    - [ ] Volume Profile: Value Area High/Low logic.
    - [ ] Time Cycle: Anchored VWAP start points.
- [ ] Define the "Scanner" architecture (Arrays & Loop logic).

## 2. Architecture Design
- [ ] Create `Macro_Scanner.pine` (The Dashboard).
    - [ ] Must handle 40 tickers (Binance + US Stock examples from video).
    - [ ] Must use `request.security` tuple packing to save execution time.
- [ ] Create `Macro_Strategy_Pro.pine` (The Execution Engine).
    - [ ] Integration of "Scanner State" into single-chart backtester.

## 3. Implementation
- [ ] **Phase A**: Math Engine (Library/Function).
- [ ] **Phase B**: Scanner UI (Table Widget).
- [ ] **Phase C**: Alert System (JSON Automation).
- [ ] **Phase D**: CEO Verification (Does it dominate?).

## 4. Documentation
- [ ] `Titan_Manual.md` (The "Blackboard" explanation).
