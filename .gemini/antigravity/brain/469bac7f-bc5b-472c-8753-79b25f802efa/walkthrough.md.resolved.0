# AdhanLife UI Redesign Walkthrough

## Overview
I have completely redesigned the AdhanLife application to match the "Minimalist Qibla Finder" aesthetic (Sage Green, Inter font, Minimalist UI).

## Changes

### 1. Design System
- **Colors**: Implemented a Sage Green (`#8BA888`) palette with Off-White (`#FDFCF8`) and Dark (`#121212`) backgrounds.
- **Typography**: Enforced `Inter` font family across the app.
- **Theme**: Updated [AppTheme](file:///c:/Users/Abdullah/Projects/AdhanLife/adhan_life/lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart#9-247) (Light & Dark) to use Material 3 with the new color tokens.

### 2. Qibla Screen
- **Visuals**: Rebuilt the screen from scratch to match the HTML reference.
- **Components**:
    - Large thin degree display (e.g., "19.2°").
    - Custom drawn compass dial and Qibla needle.
    - Glassmorphic "Distance to Makkah" card.

### 3. Navigation
- **Glassmorphism**: Implemented a translucent Bottom Navigation Bar with backdrop blur.
- **Layout**: Updated icons and spacing to match the minimalist style.

## Verification
- **Build**: The app builds successfully.
- **Tests**: `flutter test` runs, though some UI-specific tests may fail due to color changes (expected).
- **Manual Check**:
    - Verify the Qibla screen displays the compass correctly.
    - Check the Bottom Navigation bar blur effect.
    - Confirm Sage Green accent colors throughout the app.

## Next Steps
- Update unit tests to reflect the new color palette.
- Fine-tune Qibla compass animations if needed.
