## 1. Executive Summary (CEO) 👔
> **"We are not building just a list. We are building clarity."**

**Goal:** Build a frictionless, distraction-free task manager.
**Success Metric:** User adds their first task within 5 seconds of opening the app.
**Strategy:** "Less is More". No categories, no tags, no cloud sync for MVP. Local first.
